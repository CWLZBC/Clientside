        <h1 id="AmpStart">The Ampersand</h1>
        <p>
            The ampersand is the name of the logogram, <strong>&</strong>, also known as the <em>and</em> sign.
            The logogram originated as representing the ligature/combination of the letters <em>et</em> - Latin for
            "and".

                    In English-speaking schools, when reciting the alphabet, traditionally any letter that could also be
                    used as
                    a word in itself was repeated with the Latin expression <em>per se</em>.
                    This was letters such as "A", "I", and "O", followed with saying "by itself" in Latin, thereby
                    saying "A
                    per
                    se A".
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was also a common practise to add the <strong>&</strong> sign at the end of the alphabet, as if
                    it
                    were
                    the 27th letter. <br>As a result, whilst pronouncing it in Latin <em>et</em> or later in English as
                    <em>and</em>, the recitation of the alphabet would end in "X, Y, Z, <em>and per se and</em>".
                    The last phrase was routinely slurred from "<em>and per se and</em>" to "<em>ampersand</em>", thus
                    allowing
                    the term to enter common English usage by 1837.

                        <br>The term ampersand is a corruption of <em>and (&) per se and</em>, which literally means "(the character) & by itself (is the word) and." The symbol & is derived from the ligature of ET or et, which is the Latin word for "and."

            <p>
                Ampersands are commonly seen in business names formed from partnership of two or more people, such as
                <em>Johnson & Johnson</em>, <em>Dolce & Gabbana</em>, <em>Marks & Spencer</em>, and <em>Tiffany & Co.</em>, as well as some abbreviations
                containing the word and, such as:

                In film credits for stories, screenplays, etc., & indicates a closer collaboration than <em>and</em>. The
                ampersand is used by the Writers Guild of America to denote two writers collaborating on a specific script, 
                rather than one writer rewriting another's work. In screenplays, two authors joined with <em>&</em> collaborated 
                on the script, while two authors joined with <em>and</em> worked on the script at different times and may not have
                consulted each other at all. In the latter case, they both contributed enough significant material to the
                screenplay to receive credit but did not work together.
            </p>

            <p>
                In APA style, the ampersand is used when citing sources in text such as (Jones & Jones, 2005). In the
                list
                of references, an ampersand precedes the last author's name when there is more than one author.
            </p>

            <p>
                The phrase <em>et cetera</em> ("and so forth"), usually written as <em>etc.</em> can be abbreviated <em>&c.</em> representing the
                combination <em>et + c(etera)</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ampersand can be used to indicate that the "and" in a listed item is a part of the item's name and
                not a
                separator (e.g. "Rock, pop, rhythm & blues, and hip hop").
            </p>

            <p style="clear:left;">
                The ampersand may still be used as an abbreviation for "and" in informal writing regardless of how "and"
                is
                used.

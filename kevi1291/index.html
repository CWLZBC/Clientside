        <h1>The Ampersand</h1>

        <p>
            The ampersand is the name of the logogram, <strong>&</strong>, also known as the <em>and</em> sign.
            The logogram originated as representing the ligature/combination of the letters <em>et</em> - Latin for
            "and".
        </p>



        <h2 id="AmpOrigin">The Origin</h2>
        <div class="textWImage">
            <p>
                In English-speaking schools, when reciting the alphabet, traditionally any letter that could also be
                used as
                a word in itself was repeated with the Latin expression <em>per se</em>.
                This was letters such as "A", "I", and "O", followed with saying "by itself" in Latin, thereby saying "A
                per
                se A".
            </p>
            <div class="polaroid">
                <img src="/img/AmpImg.png" alt="5 Terre" style="width:100%">
                <div class="container">
                    <p>Ampersand</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                It was also a common practise to add the <strong>&</strong> sign at the end of the alphabet, as if it
                were
                the 27th letter. <br>As a result, whilst pronouncing it in Latin <em>et</em> or later in English as
                <em>and</em>, the recitation of the alphabet would end in "X, Y, Z, <em>and per se and</em>".
                The last phrase was routinely slurred from "<em>and per se and</em>" to "<em>ampersand</em>", thus
                allowing
                the term to enter common English usage by 1837.
            </p>

        <h2 id="AmpUsage">The Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Ampersands are commonly seen in business names formed from partnership of two or more people, such as
            Johnson & Johnson, Dolce & Gabbana, Marks & Spencer, and Tiffany & Co., as well as some abbreviations
            containing the word and, such as:

                </tr>
            </thead>

        <p>In film credits for stories, screenplays, etc., & indicates a closer collaboration than and. The ampersand
            is used by the Writers Guild of America to denote two writers collaborating on a specific script, rather
            than one writer rewriting another's work. In screenplays, two authors joined with & collaborated on the
            script, while two authors joined with and worked on the script at different times and may not have consulted
            each other at all. In the latter case, they both contributed enough significant material to the
            screenplay to receive credit but did not work together.
        </p>

        <p>
            In APA style, the ampersand is used when citing sources in text such as (Jones & Jones, 2005). In the list
            of references, an ampersand precedes the last author's name when there is more than one author.
        </p>

        <p>
            The phrase et cetera ("and so forth"), usually written as etc. can be abbreviated &c. representing the
            combination et + c(etera).
        </p>

        <p>
            The ampersand can be used to indicate that the "and" in a listed item is a part of the item's name and not a
            separator (e.g. "Rock, pop, rhythm & blues, and hip hop").
        </p>

        <p>
            The ampersand may still be used as an abbreviation for "and" in informal writing regardless of how "and" is
            used.

        <h2>History of Ampersand</h2>
        <p>
            The ampersand can be traced back to the 1st century A.D. and the Old Roman cursive, in which the letters E
            and T occasionally were written together to form a ligature (Evolution of the ampersand – figure 1). In the
            later and more flowing New Roman Cursive, ligatures of all kinds were extremely common; figures 2 and 3 from
            the middle of 4th century are examples of how the et-ligature could look in this script. During the later
            development of the Latin script leading up to Carolingian minuscule (9th century) the use of ligatures in
            general diminished. The et-ligature, however, continued to be used and gradually became more stylized and
            less revealing of its origin.
        </p>
        <p>
            The modern italic type ampersand is a kind of "et" ligature that goes back to the cursive scripts developed
            during the Renaissance. After the advent of printing in Europe in 1455, printers made extensive use of both
            the italic and Roman ampersands. Since the ampersand's roots go back to Roman times, many languages that use
            a variation of the Latin alphabet make use of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ampersand often appeared as a character at the end of the Latin alphabet, as for example in Byrhtferð's
            list of letters from 1011. Similarly, & was regarded as the 27th letter of the English alphabet, as
            taught to children in the US and elsewhere. An example may be seen in M. B. Moore's 1863 book The Dixie
            Primer, for the Little Folks. In her 1859 novel Adam Bede, George Eliot refers to this when she makes
            Jacob Storey say: "He thought it [Z] had only been put to finish off th' alphabet like; though ampusand
            would ha' done as well, for what he could see." The popular nursery rhyme Apple Pie ABC finishes with
            the lines "X, Y, Z, and ampersand, All wished for a piece in hand".
        </p>
        <p>
            The ampersand should not be confused with the Tironian "et" ⁊, which has the same meaning, but which in
            appearance resembles the numeral 7. Both symbols have their roots in the classical antiquity, and both signs
            were used throughout the Middle Ages as a representation for the Latin word et ("and"). However, while the
            ampersand was in origin a common ligature in everyday script, the Tironian et was part of a highly
            specialised stenographic shorthand. The Tironian et (⁊) is found in Old Irish language script, a
            Latin-based script generally only used for decorative purposes today, where it signifies agus ("and") in
            Irish. This symbol may have entered the script language by way of monastic influence in the time of the
            early Christian church in Ireland.

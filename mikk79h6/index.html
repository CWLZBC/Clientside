			<h4>The history of pizza</h4>
			<p>The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with
				several toppings. A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as
				panis focacius, to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in
				Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. The word pizza was first documented in A.D. 997 in
				Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in
				Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy
				came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.</p>

			<h4>Origin</h4>
			<p>In Sardinia, French and Italian archaeologists have found bread baked over 7,000 years ago. According to
				Philippe Marinval, the local islanders leavened this bread. Foods similar to pizza have been made
				since antiquity. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be
				found throughout ancient history.
				<br><br>
				In the 6th century BC, Persian soldiers serving under Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and
				dates on top of their battle shields. In Ancient Greece, citizens made a flat bread called plakous which
				was flavored with toppings like herbs, onion, cheese and garlic.
				An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid <em>(ca. 19 BC)</em>, when Celaeno, the
				Harpy queen,
				foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables
				<em>(Book III)</em>. In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes
				<em>(like pita bread)</em> topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that
				these are the
				"tables" prophesied by Celaeno. Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be
				traced to pizzarelle, which were kosher for Passover cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from
				the synagogue on that holiday,
				though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads. Abba Eban writes: "Some scholars
				think pizza was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers added cheese and olive oil to
				matzah".
				<br><br>
				Other examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world are focaccia
				<em>(which may date back as far as the ancient Etruscans)</em>; Manakish in Levant, coca <em>(which has
					sweet and
					savory varieties)</em> from Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands; the Greek Pita; Lepinja in
				the
				Balkans; or Piadina in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy.
				<br><br>
				Foods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese bing <em>(a wheat flour-based
					Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like shape)</em>; the Indian paratha <em>(in which fat is
					incorporated)</em>;
				the Central and South Asian naan <em>(leavened)</em> and roti <em>(unleavened)</em>; the Sardinian
				carasau, spianata,
				guttiau, pistoccu; and Finnish rieska. Also worth noting is that throughout Europe there are many
				similar pies based on the idea of covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such
				as the Alsatian flammkuchen, German zwiebelkuchen, and French quiche.
				<br><br>
				In 16th-century Naples, a galette flatbread was referred to as a pizza. Known as the dish for poor
				people, it was sold in the street and was not considered a kitchen recipe for a long time. In 1843,
				Alexandre Dumas described the diversity of pizza toppings. An often recounted story holds that on
				June 11, 1889, to honour the Queen consort of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, the Neapolitan pizzamaker
				Raffaele Esposito created the "Pizza Margherita", a pizza garnished with tomatoes, mozzarella, and
				basil, to represent the national colours of Italy as on the Flag of Italy.
				<br><br>
				Pizza evolved into a type of bread and tomato dish, often served with cheese. However, until the late
				19th or early 20th century, the dish was sweet, not savory, and earlier versions which were savory more
				resembled the flat breads now known as schiacciata. Pellegrino Artusi's classic
				early-twentieth-century cookbook, La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene gives three recipes for
				pizza, all of which are sweet. After the feedback of some readers, Artusi added a typed sheet in the
				1911 edition <em>(discovered by food historian Alberto Capatti)</em>, bound with the volume, with the
				recipe of
				"pizza alla napoletana": mozzarella, tomatoes, anchovies and mushrooms.
				<br><br>
				However, by 1927, Ada Boni's first edition of il talismano della felicità <em>(a well-known Italian
					cookbook)</em> includes a recipe using tomatoes and mozzarella.
				<br><br><br>
			</p>
			<h4>Innovation</h4>
			<p>The innovation that led to flatbread pizza was the use of tomato as a topping. For some time after the
				tomato was brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to
				be poisonous, like some other fruits of the Solanaceae <em>(nightshade)</em> family are. However, by the
				late
				18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based
				flatbread, and so the pizza began. The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a
				tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local
				specialty.
				<br><br>
				According to documents discovered by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State Archive of Naples, in 1807
				already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners and addresses. In the second half of the nineteenth
				century they increased to 120.
				<br><br>
				In Naples, two others figures connected to the trade existed — the pizza hawker <em>(pizzaiuolo
					ambulante)</em>,
				who sold pizza, but did not make it, and the seller of pizza "a oggi a otto", who made pizzas, but sold
				them in return for a payment for seven days.
				<br><br>
				The pizza marinara method has a topping of tomato, oregano, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. It is
				named "marinara" because it was traditionally the food prepared by "la marinara", the seaman's wife, for
				her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the Bay of Naples.
				<br><br>
				The margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil. It is widely
				attributed to baker Raffaele Esposito, who worked at the restaurant "Pietro... e basta così"
				<em>("Pietro...
					and that's enough")</em>, established in 1880 and still in business as "Pizzeria Brandi". Though
				recent
				research casts doubt on this legend, the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three different pizzas
				for the visit of King Umberto I and Queen Margherita of Savoy. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking
				the colors of the Italian flag — green <em>(basil leaves)</em>, white <em>(mozzarella)</em>, and red
				<em>(tomatoes)</em>.
				According to the tale, this combination was named Pizza Margherita in her honor. Although those were the
				most preferred, today there are many variations of pizzas.
				<br><br>
				"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana" <em>("True Neapolitan Pizza Association")</em>, which was founded
				in
				1984, has set the very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan pizza. These
				include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and
				must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means <em>(i pizzaioli — the pizza makers —
					make
					the pizza by rolling it with their fingers)</em> and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres
				in
				diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects
				pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.
